# Python Generators Project

This project demonstrates advanced usage of **Python generators** to handle large datasets efficiently, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. It integrates Python with a MySQL database and leverages generators for optimal performance in data-driven applications.

## Features
- Connects to a MySQL database and sets up tables.
- Inserts and streams data efficiently using Python generators.
- Handles large datasets with batch processing and lazy loading.
- Performs aggregate calculations and analytics on streaming data.
- Integrates SQL queries dynamically within Python scripts.
